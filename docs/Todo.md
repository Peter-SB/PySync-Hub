# Todo List

## Export
- export page
- error display
- Potential Bug: playlists with same names

## Playlist/Track Managment
 - Better Errors
 - Improve ui updates


## Downloading
- Add Quick Sync (That will not check file locations, only download new tracks without a location)
- FIX: Cancle Button
- Save a correct file type
- Add metadata
- - correct track artists
- Soundcloud: Flag premium tracks (that will only be 29s long but could be misleading)
- Last sync order


## Electron
- Optimise
- Tool Bar
- Tray Icons
- Investigate: Can you use the bundled FFMPEG that comes with electron/chromium?
- Proper backend shutdown. I think downloader thread is still running.

## Docker
- Fix. Broken during electron refactor.


## Other
- Further, investigate and fix any potential cors

## Settings
- Dont override other settings when saving
